      <p>I believe software engineering leaders should focus on three core pillars: the people they work with, the products they're building, and on-time delivery of commitments. By maintaining the right balance across these areas, I help teams achieve high engagement, strong morale, and exceptional performance. My goal as an engineering leader is to find this balance and enable teams to solve complex business problems effectively.</p>
